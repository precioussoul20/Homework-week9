package calculate;
/* Write a java program using the following descriptions
1. Create one package with name calculate
2. Create two class with name “Calculator” and “Main”
3. Create four methods with manes “addition”, “subtraction”, “division”,
and “multiplication”. All methods are instance methods and it doesn’t
return anything. But it has two parameters with the names “int a” and
“int b”. Also each method has System.out.println(). This prints the
result. Also create one more method with the name “calculateResult”
with three parameters with name int a, int b and char symbol. Write the
logic in the calculateResult method that when the user enters first
number and second number and symbol based on symbol it does
calculate.
4. Write a “main” method into the main class. It has a scanner that takes
user input. Also write the logic that it ask user to “Enter first Number:”,
“Enter second Number:” “Please enter one of symbol +,-,*, /:” if user
enter + symbol result like “Addition of 5 and 10 is: 15” and respective for
other symbols.
5. With the result it’s also print one more message “Would you like to do
more calculation Please enter “Y” or “N” :” (Hint use while loop if user
enter Y program asking the user to enter First Number, and if user enter
N programme should terminate)
